abstract = {Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) are a widely studied framework for coordinating interactions in cooperative multi-agent systems. In classical DCOPs, variables owned by agents are assumed to be discrete. However, in many applications, such as target tracking or sleep scheduling in sensor networks, continuous-valued variables are more suitable than discrete ones. To better model such applications, researchers have proposed Continuous DCOPs (C-DCOPs), an extension of DCOPs, that can explicitly model problems with continuous variables. The state-of-the-art approaches for solving C-DCOPs experience either onerous memory or computation overhead and are unsuitable for non-differentiable optimization problems. To address this issue, we propose a new C-DCOP algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization Based C-DCOP (PCD), which is inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a well-known centralized population-based approach for solving continuous optimization problems. In recent years, population-based algorithms have gained significant attention in classical DCOPs due to their ability in producing high-quality solutions. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, this class of algorithms has not been utilized to solve C-DCOPs and there has been no work evaluating the potential of PSO in solving classical DCOPs or C-DCOPs. In light of this observation, we adapted PSO, a centralized algorithm, to solve C-DCOPs in a decentralized manner. The resulting PCD algorithm not only produces good-quality solutions but also finds solution without any requirement for derivative calculations. Moreover, we design a crossover operator that can be used by PCD to further improve the quality of solutions found. Finally, we theoretically prove that PCD is an anytime algorithm and empirically evaluate PCD against the state-of-the-art C-DCOP algorithms in a wide variety of benchmarks.}
